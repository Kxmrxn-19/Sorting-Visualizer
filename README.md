# Sorting Visualizer

This project implements a sorting visualizer using Tkinter in Python. It includes various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort. The visualizer displays real-time sorting animations and includes a stopwatch to measure the time taken for sorting.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms.
- Stopwatch to measure sorting time.
- Options to input arrays manually or generate random arrays.
- Selection of sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (standard library)

## Getting Started

To run the sorting visualizer:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kxmrxn-19/Sorting-Visualizer.git
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```
2.  Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
## Usage

- Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Choose to input an array manually or generate a random array.
- Click "Start Sorting" to begin the visualization.
- The stopwatch will display the time taken for sorting.
